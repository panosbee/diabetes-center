# Diabetes Center Platform

## üöÄ Overview

**Diabetes Center** is a groundbreaking, AI-powered digital health platform for diabetes management, designed for both clinicians and patients. It combines advanced clinical decision support, digital twin simulation, real-time analytics, and personalized medicine, all within a secure, modular, and extensible architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend

- **Python 3.x / Flask** modular API with Blueprints for scalability.
- **MongoDB** (encrypted, document-based) for flexible, secure storage.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and JWT authentication for secure, granular permissions.
- **AI & Decision Support**: DeepSeek Medical, PubMed RAG, genetics, polygenic scores, PharmGKB, and digital twin engine.
- **File Management & OCR**: Automated extraction and structuring of medical data from uploaded documents.
- **WebRTC & SocketIO**: Real-time video calls, chat, and notifications.
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable logs and anomaly detection for compliance.

### Frontend

#### Doctor/Admin Portal (`diabetes_frontend`)
- **React + Vite** SPA.
- AI chat interface for clinical support and PubMed RAG.
- Patient management, session history, file management, analytics dashboards.
- **Interactive Diary**: Shared, editable timeline for doctor-patient communication, medication, and events.
- **WebRTC Video Calls**: Secure, browser-based video communication with patients.
- **Interactive Mindmaps**: Visualize patient data, scenarios, and outcomes with D3.js.

#### Patient PWA (`diabetes_patient_pwa`)
- **React + Vite PWA** (mobile-first, offline support).
- Full Greek localization (1700+ foods in Greek.json for macronutrient tracking).
- File upload with OCR, session management, secure messaging, and video calls.
- **Interactive Diary**: Patients can log symptoms, meals, exercise, and communicate with their doctor in real time.

## ü§ñ Key Innovations

- **Digital Twin Engine**: Patient-specific, 6-compartment glucose-insulin simulation with stochastic and circadian modeling, supporting ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenario analysis.
- **AI Clinical Decision Support**: DeepSeek Medical engine provides context-aware, evidence-based recommendations.
- **PubMed RAG Integration**: Real-time retrieval and summarization of medical literature for clinical queries.
- **PGS Catalog & SNP Database**: Polygenic risk scoring, SNP validation, and evidence-based risk stratification.
- **PharmGKB Pharmacogenomics**: Personalized drug-gene interaction analysis and dosing recommendations.
- **OCR Engine**: Automated extraction of structured data from PDFs/images (labs, prescriptions, etc.).
- **Interactive Doctor-Patient Diary**: Shared, editable timeline for tracking symptoms, medications, and lifestyle events.
- **WebRTC Video Calls**: Secure, encrypted video communication between doctor and patient, with audit trails.
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live monitoring, predictive analytics, and early warning systems.
- **Food Database**: 1700+ Greek foods with macronutrient data for precise dietary tracking.
- **PWA Patient Portal**: Mobile-friendly, offline-capable, empowering patients to manage their data and communicate with clinicians.

## üîí Security & Compliance

- **TLS 1.3, AES-256**: End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- **JWT Authentication**: Short-lived tokens, session monitoring, and rotation.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Doctors can only access their own patients and sessions.
- **Audit Logs & Anomaly Detection**: Immutable logging, ML-based analysis for suspicious activity.
- **GDPR & HIPAA Compliance**: Data minimization, right to be forgotten, data portability.
- **File Security**: Per-patient access, signed URLs, and encrypted storage.
- **WebRTC Security**: Encrypted peer-to-peer video streams, no third-party relay.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automated dependency scanning and regular security audits.
